Transcriber's Notes: Despite the severity with which the author of this
work treats those who depart from his standard of correctness, the source
text does contain a small number of typographical errors. Missing
punctuation has been supplied silently, but all other errors have been left
uncorrected. To let the reader distinguish such problems from any
inadvertent transcription errors that remain, I have inserted notes to flag
items that appear errors by Brown's own standard. Spellings that are simply
different from current practice, e.g., 'Shakspeare' are not noted. Special
characters: vowels with macrons are rendered with an equals sign (=) before
the vowel. Vowels with breve marks are rendered with tildes (~) before the
vowels.--KTH.

PREFACE

The present performance is, so far as the end could be reached, the
fulfillment of a design, formed about twenty-seven years ago, of one day
presenting to the world, if I might, something like a complete grammar of
the English language;--not a mere work of criticism, nor yet a work too
tame, indecisive, and uncritical; for, in books of either of these sorts,
